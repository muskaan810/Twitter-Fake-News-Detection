On my Japan trip my friend suggested I build a Yen conversion app, so we‚Äôll stop manually calculating prices. I made a quick PWA in an hour while everyone was sleeping the next day.

I could have totally downloaded an already existing app, but I like building things and I was able to make it:

‚úÖ 100% advertisement free
‚úÖ Offline support
‚úÖ UX streamlined for what we needed

I watched my friends use the app throughout the day. I noted times they struggled and was able to change the UX the next day.

The app automatically updated because it was a PWA ü§© -- super cool feeling to do user testing and surprise people by fixing issues almost right away üòÇ

It felt very cool to actually use what would normally be a pet project : - )

I'm still jet lagged so I've been polishing a v2 of the app the past few nights:

‚úÖ Created a logo

On my Japan trip my friend suggested I build a Yen conversion app, so we‚Äôll stop manually calculating prices. I made a quick PWA in an hour while everyone was sleeping the next day.

I could have totally downloaded an already existing app, but I like building things and I was able to make it:

‚úÖ 100% advertisement free
‚úÖ Offline support
‚úÖ UX streamlined for what we needed

I watched my friends use the app throughout the day. I noted times they struggled and was able to change the UX the next day.

The app automatically updated because it was a PWA ü§© -- super cool feeling to do user testing and surprise people by fixing issues almost right away üòÇ

It felt very cool to actually use what would normally be a pet project : - )

I'm still jet lagged so I've been polishing a v2 of the app the past few nights:

‚úÖ Created a logo
‚úÖ Added mostly all currencies in addition to USD
‚úÖ Setup a cron job to cache historic prices for the yen conversion chart (Shoutout to @ValDotTown  for the really good DX + docs for creating cron jobs/serverless functions)",kayladotdev,1434,60,52

On my Japan trip my friend suggested I build a Yen conversion app, so we‚Äôll stop manually calculating prices. I made a quick PWA in an hour while everyone was sleeping the next day.

I could have totally downloaded an already existing app, but I like building things and I was able to make it:

‚úÖ 100% advertisement free
‚úÖ Offline support
‚úÖ UX streamlined for what we needed

I watched my friends use the app throughout the day. I noted times they struggled and was able to change the UX the next day.

The app automatically updated because it was a PWA ü§© -- super cool feeling to do user testing and surprise people by fixing issues almost right away üòÇ

It felt very cool to actually use what would normally be a pet project : - )

I'm still jet lagged so I've been polishing a v2 of the app the past few nights:
